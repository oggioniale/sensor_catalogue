\title{Convert SensorML sensor type XML files into RDF/Turtle representation}
\usage{
sensors_type_rdf(
  files_path = NULL,
  creator_name = NULL,
  creator_surname = NULL,
  creator_orcid = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{files_path}{Character string. The path to the local directory containing
the downloaded SensorML XML files for a sensor system type and its components.
The directory must include at least one file under \verb{system/} and optionally several
under \verb{components/}.}

\item{creator_name}{Character. First name of the sensor owner.}

\item{creator_surname}{Character. Last name of the sensor owner.}

\item{creator_orcid}{Character. ORCID of the sensor owner (e.g. \code{"0000-0002-1825-0097"}).}
}
\value{
The function produces one or more RDF/Turtle files in the subdirectory
\verb{system_components_files_ttl/}. It does not return an object in R.
If the provided XML does not represent a sensor type, the function stops
with an informative message.
}
\description{
This function reads a local directory containing SensorML XML descriptions
of a sensor \emph{type} (and its possible component types), extracts relevant
metadata such as identifiers, capabilities, manufacturer, observed
properties, and relationships, and generates corresponding RDF/Turtle (\code{.ttl})
files following the SOSA/SSN ontology and schema.org properties.
}
\details{
The function processes SensorML files that follows the OGC SensorML 2.0 specification.
It identifies whether the XML describes a sensor \emph{type} (i.e., a reusable
system description rather than an instance) by checking the value of
\code{swes:extension/swe:Boolean/swe:value}.
If the file is confirmed as a type, the function:
\itemize{
\item Parses the main system SensorML file under \verb{system/};
\item Extracts identifiers, descriptions, manufacturer info, and capabilities;
\item Detects and parses all component SensorML files under \verb{components/};
\item Writes one \code{.ttl} file for the system type and one for each component type;
\item Serializes RDF triples using SOSA, SSN, PROV, DCAT, FOAF, and Schema.org vocabularies.
}
The resulting TTL files are stored in a folder named \code{system_components_files_ttl}
within the input path.
}
\note{
The generated RDF files can be uploaded to a Fuseki triple store
(e.g. dataset \verb{/systemsType}) using a subsequent script or API call.

\title{Generate SensorML XML description for a sensor system type}
\usage{
sensors_sysTypeXML(sensorList, uuidsList)
}
\arguments{
\item{sensorList}{A \code{data.frame} or tibble containing metadata for the system and its components.
Must include fields such as \code{sensor_level}, \code{name}, \code{manufacturer}, \code{model_name}, etc.}

\item{uuidsList}{A character vector of UUIDs corresponding to each sensor and component.}
}
\value{
The function writes one XML file to
\verb{Sensors_files_system_<UUID>/system/ID_system_<UUID>.xml}.
It does not return any R object.
}
\description{
This function creates a SensorML 2.0 XML file describing a sensor \strong{system type},
using metadata from a structured sensor data frame.
It populates standard SensorML sections including identification, classification,
characteristics, capabilities, contacts, and documentation,
and stores the XML under \verb{Sensors_files_system_<UUID>/system/}.
}
\details{
The function expects a data frame containing system-level metadata (e.g. name, model,
manufacturer, accuracy, resolution, physical properties, etc.) and a vector of UUIDs.
It reads a base XML template (\code{baseSystem_insertSensor.xml}), fills the relevant fields,
retrieves additional metadata (e.g., units and manufacturer URI) from SPARQL endpoints,
and writes the final SensorML PhysicalSystem XML.
The generated XML conforms to OGC SensorML 2.0 and can be registered in a Sensor Observation Service (SOS).

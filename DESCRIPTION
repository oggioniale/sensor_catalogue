Description: 
 Provides a suite of tools for creating, transforming, and validating metadata 
 about sensors, their components, and their manufacturers. The workflow starts 
 from tabular data (e.g., Excel) describing sensors and produces SensorML files 
 for both sensor systems and components, RDF/Turtle files for sensor types and 
 instances, and RDF records for manufacturers. The package ensures compliance 
 with the SOSA/SSN ontology, FOAF, PROV, DCAT, and PIDINST schemas, allowing 
 integration with FAIR data catalogues and triple stores such as Apache Jena Fuseki.
 Each generated RDF/Turtle file is automatically validated for structural 
 consistency and ontology compliance using rdflib. The overall solution supports 
 the generation of HTML landing pages via XSLT transformations and follows the 
 latest SOSA/SSN specifications (W3C 2017 and October 2025 drafts). The package 
 is also aligned with the PIDINST schema 
 (https://docs.pidinst.org/en/latest/white-paper/metadata-schema.html) and, through 
 this, with the DataCite Metadata Schema 4.4. An example of a compliant 
 SensorML–PIDINST implementation is available at 
 https://linkedsystems.uk/system/instance/TOOL0022_2490/current/.
